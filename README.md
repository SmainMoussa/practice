# practice

practicing some javascript, php and more. . . .

                                                    What I have reviewed for now:

**JAVASCRIPT**

- variables
- conditions
- loops
- functions
- hoisting
- this operator
- prototypes
- try catch

**PHP**

**SASS**
To install SASS Anywhere (standalone)

- download your version: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.43.4
- extract it in your project folder
- ./dart-sass/sass(folder) sass/style.scss style.css
- parameter --watch to auto apply changes on save
- can @import multiple libs inside the scss files and it will automatically add it to the main style.css
